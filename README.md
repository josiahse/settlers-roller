# Settlers Roller

## Features

+ Rolls dice for regular Settlers and for the Cities and Knights expansion pack
+ Allows for a house rule for the robber for the Cities and Knights expansion mode that does not allow 7's to be rolled until the barbarians come for the first time (I typically play with this rule as I find it speeds up the early game a bit)
+ Tracks the data from the game for later analysis

## To-Do's:
+ Add some way to export data to a .csv for graphing
+ Add visualization of data to site
